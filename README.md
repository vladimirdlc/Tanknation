Just Another Tank Game
======

TankNation (2009) is an university project. The game consist of a classical Deathmatch of tanks with spawned powerups. 
It featured multiplayer online capabilities and offline through an IA.

The game was made in C++ with Clanlib SDK and its score handling using SQLite (local), and MySQL databases (global).
Most of the code is in Spanish, I will try to translate it into the future, but you're welcome to do so. 

To download a binary (Windows) go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/tanknation/

This game may be ported to Linux.
